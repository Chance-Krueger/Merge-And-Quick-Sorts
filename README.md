# Merge-And-Quick-Sorts
## Description
This MIPS assembly program implements efficient merge sort and quicksort algorithms with utility functions. It merges sorted arrays using indices and recursively partitions arrays around pivots for sorting. Optimized with registers, it includes debugging calls for step-by-step process monitoring.


## What I learned: 
    - How to implement merge sort and quicksort in MIPS assembly language.
    - Managing array traversal and merging with index pointers at the assembly level.
    - Using recursion and partitioning in assembly for quicksort.
    - Efficient register usage to reduce memory access and improve performance.
    - Incorporating debugging techniques to trace and verify algorithm steps.
    - Understanding low-level control flow and data manipulation in assembly language.



## How To run it:
### To run this MIPS assembly sorting program, users should:
    - Open the .s file in a MIPS simulator such as Mars or SPIM.
    - Assemble the code using the simulator’s assemble or build function.
    - Load the provided test file containing sample input arrays for sorting.
    - Execute the program within the simulator, using run or step options to observe the sorting process.
    - Review the sorted output in the simulator’s memory or registers window.
    - The repository includes a test file for convenient verification of functionality. Debugging functions 
    (merge_debug and quicksort_debug) are available for step-by-step monitoring.



## Future Improvements
    - Enhanced Input Handling
    - Performance Optimization
    - Additional Algorithms
