# Merge-And-Quick-Sorts
This MIPS assembly program implements efficient merge sort and quicksort algorithms with utility functions. It merges sorted arrays using indices and recursively partitions arrays around pivots for sorting. Optimized with registers, it includes debugging calls for step-by-step process monitoring.
